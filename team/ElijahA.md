Ello, I am a 4th year CS major with no real set career path. I enjoy basic things like football, video games, and music. 
I came to UCSB to force myself to be social, and I would say it has worked. I have an intrest in optimization and bug fixing, specifically in video games.
Nothing is more rewarding then finding an issue, tracking down why it is happening, then fixing it. Unless you do not, in which case the suffering is never ending.
